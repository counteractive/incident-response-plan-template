## Role: Deputy Incident Commander (Deputy)

### Description

A Deputy Incident Commander (Deputy) is a direct support role for the Incident Commander (IC). The Deputy enables the IC to focus on the problem at hand, rather than worrying about documenting steps or monitoring timers. The deputy supports the IC and keeps them focused on the incident.  As a Deputy, you will be expected to take over command from the IC if they request it.

### Duties

1. Bring up issues to the Incident Commander that may otherwise not be addressed (keeping an eye on timers that have been started, circling back around to missed items from a roll call, etc).
1. Be a "hot standby" Incident Commander, should the primary need to either transition to a SME, or otherwise have to step away from the IC role.
1. Manage the incident call, and be prepared to remove people from the call if instructed by the Incident Commander.
1. Monitor the status of the incident, and notify the IC if/when the incident escalates in severity level.
1. Monitor timers:
    * track how long the incident has been running
    * notify the IC every X minutes so they can take actions (_e.g._, "IC, be advised the incident is now at the 10 minute mark.")
1. Monitor task deadlines (e.g., "IC, be advised the timer for [TEAM]'s investigation is up.")

### Training

* Read and understand the incident response plan, including the roles and playbooks.

#### Prerequisites

* Be trained as an [Incident Commander](#role-incident-commander-ic).
