# Glossary

### Incident Commander / IC
The incident commander is the person responsible for bringing any major incident to resolution. They are the highest ranking individual on any major incident call, regardless of their day-to-day rank. Their decisions made as commander are final.

### Deputy
Typically the backup IC. The deputy's job is to support the IC during the call, providing them with any help they need.

### Scribe
The scribe's job is to keep a log of all activities performed during the call in a written chat log on Slack.

### Resolver
A person on the incident call who is able to help resolve issues within a particular system. Also referred to as an SME (see below).

### SME
"Subject Matter Expert", someone who is an expert in a particular service or subject who can provide information to the IC, and perform resolution actions for a particular system.

### Command Staff
The Command Staff consists of the Incident Commander, Deputy, and Scribe.

### CAN Report
CAN stands for "Conditions" "Actions" "Needs", if an IC asks you for a CAN report, you should provide the current state of your service (condition), what actions need to be taken to return it to a healthy state (actions), and what support you need in order to perform the actions (needs).

### Span of Control
Refers to the number of direct reports you have. For example, if the IC has 10 people as direct reports on a call, they have a large span of control. We aim to make the span of control as minimal as we can while still being productive.

### Grenade Thrower
Someone who joins the call at a late time in the game, and provides information that completely derails the current thinking. They then leave almost immediately.

### Executive Swoop
When an executive comes on the call and drops some sort of bombshell. A version of grenade throwing.
